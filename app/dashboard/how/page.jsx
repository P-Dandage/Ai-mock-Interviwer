  <h1>How AI <span> MockInterview</span> Works </h1>
  <p>
    Our AI-based Mock Interview Evaluator offers a smart, interactive, and fully automated platform 
    tailored for students and job seekers to sharpen their interview skills. Unlike traditional methods 
    that depend on human evaluators, this system leverages artificial intelligence to provide 
    personalized, unbiased, and real-time feedback.
    <br /><br />
    The platform dynamically generates role-specific questions based on your academic background and career goals. 
    With voice-based answering and webcam analysis, it evaluates your performance through speech clarity, facial expressions, 
    confidence, and answer relevanceâ€”offering a real-world interview simulation experience.
    <br /><br />
    After each session, users receive a detailed performance report including scores, suggestions, and confidence insights, 
    helping them identify strengths and areas of improvement. Progress is tracked over time, allowing repeated practice and self-evaluation.
    <br /><br />
    This web-based tool is accessible anytime, anywhere, making interview preparation flexible, effective, and secure. 
    Whether you're a student, job aspirant, or part of a training institute, the AI Mock Interview Evaluator brings structure, objectivity, 
    and smart analytics to your interview journey.
